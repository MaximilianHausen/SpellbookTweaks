# Spellbook Tweaks (Forge 1.19.2)

Some tweaks to [Iron's Spells and Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks), such as replacing the mana system with one inspired by Fundamental Forces.

## Contents

- Replaces the current mana system is with a more interesting one, inspired by [Fundamental Forces](https://discord.gg/4J2ZM6T8nT). In short: Instead of a single mana value, there are two mana "tanks". One big tank that slowly recharges over time and a smaller one that is automatically refilled from the big one. This system brings long term effects to using magic and encourages a more balanced playstyle.
- Introduces new equipment buffs like regen rate, transfer rate, reserve capacity and cooldown reduction
- Rebalences spell costs and equipment buffs to bring more diversity into the gear choices and reduce the impact of mana capacity
