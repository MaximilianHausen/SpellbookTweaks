# Spellbook Tweaks (Forge 1.20.1)

Some tweaks to [Iron's Spells and Spellbooks](https://modrinth.com/mod/irons-spells-n-spellbooks), focused on balencing armor effects and making specialization a requirement to access the most powerful spells.

## Changes

- Decreased max mana values across the board and reduced the effects that max mana has on the mana regen rate
- Casting higher rarity spells now requires a certain level of "spell proficiency", a new armor attribute. As a result of this, casting legendary spells is only possible with a full armor set of that magic school
